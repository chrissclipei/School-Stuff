In this assignment we created a program called *httpserver* that would essentially emulate a client server interface and would be able to use basic requests like GET or PUT which would either retrieve a file's content on the server side and print it to the `stdout` on the client side or take the content of a file on the client side specified by a target file name and write it to the server side in the specified file name.

## Usage
`./httpserver localhost 8080`<br/>
