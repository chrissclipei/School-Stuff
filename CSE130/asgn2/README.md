In this assignment we created a program called *httpserver* which would utilize multithreading and logging as additional options, which would be specified by the command line. *Note that logging was not implemented in this code as it produced a critical error with multithreading functionality*

## Usage
`./httpserver localhost 8080 -N 7 -l test.txt`<br/>
